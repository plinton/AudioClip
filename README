                       AudioClip.js


AudioClip.js provides a simple object for playing audio, 
potentially at the same time as itself. It comes with one 
function, play, which offers two optional arguments: start 
and finish, which start the audio at the specified time and 
end it at the specified time (both in seconds). The purpose of 
this object is to be used in situations such as games where an 
sound effect might be used multiple times with potential overlap.
